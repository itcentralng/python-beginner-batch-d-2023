# Q2 Write a function that takes two lists e.g. list1=["name", "age", "height"]
# list2 = ["Ahmad Sani", 15, 1.6] and 
# returns a dictionary e.g. {"name":"Ahmad Sani", "age":15, "height":1.6

# Q2. Write a State and Capital Game where users are presented with a state
# for which they provide the capital, if they are correct the program
# indicates that and if they are wrong the program corrects them and continues
# until all states are exhausted or the user wants to quit.
# Keep track of users score, if they get it right they get 5 points,
# if they get it wrong, 3 points are deducted.
# At the end of the game you show them how their performance and ask them
# to quit or play again.
# If they choose to play they again, you restart the game, otherwise you quit.
# Also, keep track of the user names

# 3. Write a Python program to find the most frequent character in a string.

num3=7
num4=10

print(num1+num2+num3+num4)
